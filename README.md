# CS6423-DBSI
My Adv DBSI solutions

This repository contains my solutions for Advanced Database Systems Implementation (Part 2 of the course) at Georgia Intstitute of Technology. The labs have a heavy use of modern C++ with emphasis on safe memory pointers (std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr).

Test cases only pass if there is no memory leak and is checked by Valgrind when running the tests.

Lab 1: External Sort
Lab 2: Logging and Recovery
Lab 3: MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
Lab 4: Query Optimization
